# Reslop

Generative sibling of `/aj-deslop`. Where `/aj-deslop` deletes low-value prose, `/aj-reslop` *rewrites* it — grounded in the code, not in marketing instincts.

## Hard rules

1. **Never invent behavior.** If the code doesn't show it, don't claim it. No "thread-safe" unless the code actually synchronizes. No "idempotent" unless it demonstrably is. No "future-proof" ever.
2. **Never invent performance claims.** Rewrites must not introduce numeric speedups, throughput figures, latency bounds, or scale claims unless they are cited in **`docs/benchmarks.md`** (or the harnesses at `tests/bench/` / `vfl-core/benches/`). If the original prose said "10× faster" and you can't find a measurement that supports it, strike the claim — don't rephrase it. The "Unsupported quantitative / comparative claims" section of `.claude/skills/_shared/hate-words.md` is the pattern list.
3. **No hate-words.** See `.claude/skills/_shared/hate-words.md` — the rewrite must not reintroduce slop you came to fix.
4. **Don't restate the signature.** Type annotations already tell the reader the types. Docstring prose is for purpose and non-obvious constraints.
5. **Prefer shorter.** One sentence beats three. If nothing needs saying, say nothing — hand the target back to `/aj-deslop` to delete outright.
6. **Match surrounding style.** If the module's other docstrings are one-liners, yours is too. If they use Google-style `Args:` / `Returns:`, match that — only if the arguments genuinely need explanation beyond their types.

## Workflow

1. **Scope.** Default to the file(s) the user named, or pending-change files if they said "rewrite the docstrings in my changes". Never touch files outside scope.

2. **For each target (function, class, module docstring):**
   - `Read` the implementation in full.
   - `Grep` for call sites inside the repo to see how it's actually used.
   - Check the adjacent test file for invariants the tests enforce.
   - Draft a docstring grounded in those three sources — no extra sources.

3. **Fan out only when scope is large.** If the target list spans >5 files, dispatch parallel `Explore` subagents — one per file. Brief each with the hard rules, the hate-words glossary, and the three read sources. Each subagent returns proposed rewrites as old→new diffs. Main agent consolidates.

4. **Present.** Group diffs by file, ask `apply all / apply selected / skip?`. On `--apply` or clearly "just do it", write directly with `Edit`.

## What triggers a rewrite

- Docstrings that trip the hate-word glossary.
- Docstrings that only restate the signature or repeat type annotations.
- Comments narrating WHAT a line does when the name already says.
- Module docstrings talking about "phases", "best practices", or AI-assistant audiences.
- Anything the user points at explicitly.

## What to leave alone

- Accurate docstrings under ~2 lines that don't use hate-words.
- Load-bearing WHY comments (same Keep list as `/aj-deslop`).
- Generated/stub files (`*.pyi`, protobuf output).
- Tests — their names are the documentation; don't over-describe.
- License headers, SPDX identifiers, shebangs.

## Output format

```
python/velocity/server.py:120  _load_rust_core
  old: """Lazy import of the Rust extension so that the pure-Python package is
         still importable even if the native extension has not been compiled yet.
         The compiled symbols are described in `_core.pyi` for static analyzers."""
  new: """Import `velocity._core` if built; return (None, False) otherwise."""
  why: original restates mechanism the function body already shows.
```

Include the `why:` line only when the edit is borderline — skip it for obvious cuts.

## When to hand off to /aj-deslop

If the "fix" is just deleting the docstring entirely (because nothing about the function needs explaining and the name is clear), say so and let `/aj-deslop` handle it. Don't invent a rewrite to fill the slot.

## Why this skill is quiet

Output is the diffs. Don't narrate "I read the code and realized…" — show old → new, one `why:` line when borderline, nothing else.
